it was not really made to make a website, this page was rendered using
this software.

------------------------------------------------

A repetition detector written in Rust. Code is
[here](https://github.com/lise-henry/caribon), but you can also test
it [in your browser](http://vps184889.ovh.net/caribon/) because of
[caribon-server](https://github.com/lise-henry/caribon-server) runs it
as a Webservice.

[stemmer-rs](https://github.com/lise-henry/stemmer-rs)

word in various language. Used by Caribon.
