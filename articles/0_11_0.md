Annoucing Crowbook 0.11.0!
================================

I'm pleased to announce the
[0.11.0](https://github.com/lise-henry/crowbook/releases/tag/v0.11.0) 
release of [Crowbook](https://github.com/lise-henry/crowbook), a
converter from books written in Markdown to PDF, EPUB and HTML! 

Since I never made a proper blog post to talk about Crowbook (in english at
least) (the first release was announced on the
[Rust reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/46xla6/crowbook_yet_another_converter_from_markdown_to/) but
didn't go into much detail), and it's a good time in the year to pause
a little and look at what has been done in the last 12 months, I
thought it would be a good occasion to do so.

What is crowbook?
---------------------

So, what is Crowbook? It's yet another tool that takes Markdown files
and convert them to HTML, PDF and EPUB. The format is quite simple,
e.g. looking not further than this very document, the code looks like this:

Annoucing Crowbook 0.11.0!
================================

I'm pleased to announce the
[0.11.0](https://github.com/lise-henry/crowbook/releases/tag/v0.11.0) 
release of [Crowbook](https://github.com/lise-henry/crowbook), a

[...]
```

So, yeah, it's Markdown, plus some options to set title, author, and
the ouput files that must be generated (here, PDF and HTML). With
this, you can then run 

```
$ crowbook -s 0.11.0.md
```

and it will generate an HTML and a PDF file. The `-s` argument is
short for `--single`, and it simply tells `crowbook` that it is
processing a Markdown file embedding some additional options. The
other way of calling Crowbook is without with argument and with a full
book configuration files, listing all Markdown chapters that are part
of the book:

```yaml
author: Jane Doe
title: A great novel
lang: en
cover: some_cover.png

output.html: great_novel.html
output.pdf: great_novel.pdf
output.epub: great_novel.epub

- intro.md
+ chapter_01.md
+ chapter_02.md
```

So, that's basically a list of key/value pairs in a YAML syntax (you
can run `crowbook --list-options` to get the full list of valid
options), followed by the lisf of chapter names, prefixed by `-` (if
they are not numbered), `+` (if they are numbered) or `!` (if the
title should be hidden).

I won't go too much into the details here, you can look at
the [Github page](https://github.com/lise-henry/crowbook) and the
[user guide](http://lise-henry.github.io/crowbook/book/book.html) for
more information.
